Bank Records is a label stemming from the artist collective surrounding 'The Bank', a recording studio, artists studio space and venue in an old bank in Preston, Victoria, Australia.

The Bank was established in 2011 by Liam Barton and Bryony Hughes and subsequently became a home for artists and musicians. All day festivals were held in the large backyard called 'Bank Holidays' and band nights such as 'Bank Hootenannys' soon evolved in the area which was once filled with bank tellers and vaults.

Bands born at the bank include LaliÄ‡, RVG, Gregor, Hearing and Faye Soft. Bands recorded at the bank include 2 Steps on the Water, Drug Sweat, Mangelwurzel, Sweet Whirl, Footy and Suss Cunts.

In 2017 the Bank expanded to become an independent record label, with a focus on releasing eclectic music made by friends. Current Label signees are Hearing, Cyanide Thornton, Footy and Caroline No.
