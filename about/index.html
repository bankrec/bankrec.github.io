Bank Records is a label born out of the artist collective surrounding 'The Bank', a recording studio, artists studio spaces and venue in an old bank in Preston, Victoria, Australia.

The Bank was established in 2011 by Liam Barton and Bryony Hughes and quickly became a hub for artists and musicians. They held notorious all day festivals in the large backyard called 'Bank Holidays' and band nights such as 'Bank Hootenannys' in the area which was once filled with bank tellers and the vault.

Bands born at the bank include Lalic, RVG, Gregor, Hearing and Faye Soft. Bands recorded at the bank include 2 Steps on the Water, Drug Sweat, Mangelwurzel, Sweet Whirl, Footy and Suss Cunts.

In 2016 the Bank expanded to become an independent record label, with a focus on releasing pop music at the weirder end of the spectrum, made by artists surrounding the scene. Current Label signees are Hearing, Cyanide Thornton, Footy and Caroline No.
